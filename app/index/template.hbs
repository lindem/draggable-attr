<h1>Unexplained behaviour in Ember 3.5</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  The draggable attribute can legitimately be set to three states as per the
  HTML 5.1 standard, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/editing.html#the-draggable-attribute">section 5.7.7</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  All html elements may have the draggable content attribute set. The draggable attribute is an enumerated attribute.
  It has three states. The first state is true and it has the keyword true. The second state is false and it has the
  keyword false. The third state is auto; it has no keywords but it is the missing value default.
</blockquote>
<p>
  However, I cannot seem to set draggable to explicit <code>"false"</code>; I can only set draggable to null, which
  equals <code>auto</code>.

<label>
  {{input type="checkbox" checked=(mut lockstatus) name="locked"}}
  Lock the draggable.
</label>

{{dnd-wrapper locked=lockstatus}}
